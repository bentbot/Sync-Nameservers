# Sync Nameservers

## Version 2

1. 
   - Setup a cronjob to run each & every minute throughout the day. 
   - Point it to the absolute path of the `update_dns.sh` script in this repository.
 
 ````
  [user@localhost]$ pwd ./dnsupdate.sh
  [root@localhost]$ sudo crontab -e
  * * * * * /srv/scripts/dnsupdate.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
  crontab: installing new crontab
````

2. 
   - Open the file `./namedotcomapi/autoip.php` and change the needed configuration variables.
   - Change the NAME.COM API credentials to relect your own ns1 & ns2 domain registrar account.
   - If needed, replace the bottom section of the file with your own API script, one that suits your registrar.
   - Optional: Disable either NS1 / NS2 to make this server behave as a singular nameserver (automatic failover option is still in development).

## Troublesoot

Open cPanel WHM and double-check the following IP settings, making sure they are set to the current IP address you see when the script runs.

__Troubleshooting Procedure__

  - `[root@localhost]$ ./dnsupdate.sh`
  - Log in to WHM and browse to __Basic WebHost ManagerÂ® Setup__ > Find: '__ip__'
  - Change the address in the first box: __Basic Config__ > __IP__ To the new IP if different.
  - Click the __Configure Address Records__ in the __Nameservers__ section at the bottom.
  - Paste the IP into the __NS1 IPv4 A record__ input box. Press __Configure Address Records__.
  - Optional: __Configure Address Records__ again for __NS2__ if the IP address for NS2 isn't the same address.


## Version 1

AKA: __ipaddr.php__

Automatically synchronizes cPanel & your ns1/ns2 nameservers with your WHM/cPanel server on a dynamic / non-static IP address.

This is a simple script to update cPanel with the correct new IP address when it has changed or you are not able to host on a static IP.
It also works with NAME.COM domain name registrar to update your service's nameservers to your new public IP address.

In the script there is an array of subdomains containing what are cPanel's default records. These are updated to the correct public IP address after you have configured the script. Additional subdomains can be added there to create new zones or update custom zones.

## Instructions:

1. Modify the `ip_addr.php` file to include your WHM/cPanel API & Name.Com API keys.
2. Change the domain and nameservers to your own when in `ip_addr.php`
3. Login to your cPanel installation as 'root' or another user and upload the script to a non-public dir.
4. Add the following to your Cron tab:
````
  */2 * * * * php /root/<path>/ip_addr.php
  @reboot php /root/<path>/ip_addr.php
````
5. At the very bottom of `ipaddr.php`, change the argument to 'false' to only update NS recoreds remotely.
